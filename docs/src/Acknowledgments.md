# Acknowledgments

Work on Websocket.jl was undertaken to provide myself with familiar tool patterns I am used to using in Node.js.

As such, this package is very much in debt to the architecture of the most excellent Node.js [websocket](https://www.npmjs.com/package/websocket)
package by [theturtle32](https://github.com/theturtle32).

Also, thanks to the team of [HTTP.jl](https://github.com/JuliaWeb/HTTP.jl) for the groundwork in bringing HTTP to Julia.
